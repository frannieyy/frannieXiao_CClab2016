I made a project that when you squeeze the bear's hand, his heart will be light up. The brightness of that LED is changing depend on
how hard you squeeze the bear's hand, which contains a force sensor in it. The project is made to be a gift for one's girlfriend to
show their love. When you squeeze the teddy bear's hand harder, the LED light became stronger, which means that the love is stronger.

-Development Process:
I was trying to make a talkable teddy bear with a touch sensor on it's hand as the switch at first, but I couldn't make the SD card
reader working, I changed my project into this teddy bear with a lightable heart. Since the original design concept of my first idea
is to make a romantic present for nerdy to give to their girlfriend, the new project still serve this same idea.
